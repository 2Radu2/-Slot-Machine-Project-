# -Slot-Machine-Project-
## Introduction
This project is a custom-built slot machine using an Arduino Uno, ILI9341 TFT screen, and a 1602A LCD. It features interactive buttons for playing, adjusting bets, and adding credits, as well as a visually appealing 3x5 grid for displaying slot symbols.

## Features
* Interactive Gameplay: Adjust bets and play using dedicated buttons.
* Custom Graphics: Rendered slot symbols on a TFT screen with weighted probabilities for symbol rarity.
* Dynamic Credit System: Track and update credits and bets on the LCD display.
* Realistic Payout Logic: Modeled after professional slot machines with payouts for rows and diagonals.
* Expandable Design: Enclosed in a 3D-printed case designed using Autodesk 3ds Max, with detachable legs and a sliding back lid.
